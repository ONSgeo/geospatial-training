# Introduction to GIS in Python

## Course Summary
### Introduction
This course provides an introduction to working with geospatial data in Python for experienced Python users. 

### Estimated time for course
2-3 hours

### Audience
Python users wanting to work with geospatial data.

### Course Aims
By the end of the course you will:
  
* Know how to load spatial data into Python using the `geopandas` package.
* Be familiar with using GSS codes to join statistics to geographies.
* Understand how spatial objects can be manipulated.
* Understand how to use spatial joins.
* Be aware of map projections and Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) and be able to modify them.
* Know how to make static and interactive maps.
* Be able to export your maps and shapefiles.

### Requirements
* We recommend completing the [Practical Geography for Statistics](https://onsgeo.github.io/geospatial-training/docs/practical_geog_and_stats) training prior to starting this course.
* Python and Jupyter Notebooks installed 
* Beginner/Intermediate knowledge of Python and Pandas.

### Course Instructions
The course materials are [available here](https://github.com/ONSgeo/Introduction_to_GIS_in_Python). Download the repository to your local drive.

To open Jupyter Notebooks, open up the Anaconda prompt and activate the GeoPy38 virtual environment. See [Installation guide for Python Geospatial Packages](https://onsgeo.github.io/geospatial-training/docs/guides/python_install_anaconda)
Once you have the virtual environment activated, open up jupyter notebook by typing:

*jupyter notebook*
