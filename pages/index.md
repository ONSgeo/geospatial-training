# Geography for Statistics Training

Courses and guidance provided by the *Office for National Statistics' Geospatial Team* to help you get to grips with using geography and statistics. 

The courses have been developed for those working at ONS and across the Government Statistical Service. However, we hope these resources will also be useful for anyone else who integrates geography and statistics.
